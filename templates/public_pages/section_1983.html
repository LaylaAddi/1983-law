                <h2 class="section-title">What Is Section 1983?</h2>
                <p class="lead text-muted mb-4">
                    Section 1983 is a federal law that allows citizens to sue government officials—including
                    police officers, government employees, and agencies—who violate their constitutional rights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Originally passed as part of the <strong>Civil Rights Act of 1871</strong> (also known as
                    the Ku Klux Klan Act), Section 1983 was designed to combat the widespread civil rights
                    violations occurring in the post-Civil War South. It gave freed slaves and their allies
                    a way to seek justice in federal courts when state courts were hostile to their rights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, Section 1983 remains one of the most important civil rights laws in America.
                    It's used thousands of times each year to hold police officers, prison guards, school
                    officials, and other government actors accountable for constitutional violations.

                    Section 1983 provides several forms of relief for victims of civil rights violations.
                    The goal is to make you "whole"—to put you back in the position you would have been
                    in if your rights hadn't been violated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In some cases, Section 1983 judgments have resulted in significant awards. While every
                    case is different, courts have awarded damages ranging from nominal amounts to millions
                    of dollars depending on the severity of the violation.

                <p class="lead text-center text-muted mb-5">
                    Qualified immunity is a legal doctrine that can shield government officials from liability—
                    but it's not absolute, and many cases successfully overcome it.

                                Qualified immunity is a court-created doctrine that protects government officials
                                from civil liability unless they violated "clearly established" constitutional rights.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The idea is that officials should not be held liable for conduct that they reasonably
                                believed was lawful at the time.

                        Don't assume qualified immunity will defeat your case. Many plaintiffs successfully
                        recover damages despite this defense.

                                Section 1983 claims are subject to a <strong>statute of limitations</strong>—a deadline
                                by which you must file your lawsuit. The time limit varies by state because federal
                                courts use each state's personal injury statute of limitations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Typical time limits range from 1 to 6 years</strong>, with most states falling
                                in the 2-3 year range. The clock usually starts ticking on the date of the violation.
                            </p>

                                <strong>Don't wait.</strong> Consult with an attorney as soon as possible to understand
