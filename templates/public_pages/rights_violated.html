                        Organizations like the ACLU, NAACP, and local legal aid societies
                        may be able to help with your case, provide referrals, or take on
                        cases that have broader implications for civil rights.

                                Section 1983 claims have a <strong>statute of limitations</strong>—a deadline
                                by which you must file your lawsuit. This varies by state but is typically
                                <strong>2-3 years</strong> from the date of the incident.
                            </p>

                                <strong>Don't wait.</strong> The sooner you document your case and consult with
                                an attorney, the better your chances of success. Evidence can disappear,
                                memories fade, and witnesses become harder to locate over time.

                    Section 1983 gives you the power to hold them accountable. Many people have successfully
                    pursued justice for civil rights violations—and you can too.
