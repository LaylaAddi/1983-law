        <p class="lead">
            The First Amendment protects your right to record police officers and government officials
            performing their duties in public. Courts across America have affirmed this right.

                <h2 class="section-title">The Right to Record is Clearly Established</h2>
                <p class="lead text-muted mb-4">
                    Federal courts have consistently ruled that recording police in public is a constitutionally protected activity
                    under the First Amendment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This right stems from the freedom of the press—which applies to <em>all</em> citizens, not just professional
                    journalists. In the age of smartphones, every citizen is a potential journalist with the power to document
                    government activity and hold officials accountable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When police officers are performing their duties in public spaces, they have no reasonable expectation of privacy.
                    The public has a right to observe and document their conduct.

                    <p>
                        Simon Glik was arrested for recording police making an arrest in Boston Common.
                        The court ruled that the First Amendment protects the right to record police
