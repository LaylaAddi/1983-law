                            <p>To invoke your Fifth Amendment rights, clearly state:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>"I invoke my right to remain silent."</li>

                                <em>Simply staying silent may not be enough—courts have held you should
                                affirmatively invoke your rights.</em>

                <h3 class="mt-5 mb-4">Miranda Rights</h3>
                <p>
                    You've probably heard "You have the right to remain silent..." on TV. These are your
                    <strong>Miranda rights</strong>, which police must read to you before custodial interrogation:
                </p>
                <div class="bg-patriot-light p-4 rounded-3 mb-4">
                    <ul class="mb-0">
                        <li>You have the right to remain silent</li>
                        <li>Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law</li>
                        <li>You have the right to an attorney</li>
                        <li>If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
                    <strong>Important:</strong> Miranda warnings are only required during <em>custodial interrogation</em>
                    (when you're not free to leave and police are asking questions designed to elicit incriminating responses).
                    Your Fifth Amendment rights exist whether or not Miranda warnings are given.

                    <p class="mb-0">
                        Some states have "stop and identify" laws that may require you to provide your name
                        when lawfully detained. However, you still cannot be required to answer questions
                        about alleged criminal activity. Check your state's specific laws.

                <h3 class="mt-5 mb-4">Due Process</h3>
                <p>
                    The Fifth Amendment also guarantees <strong>due process of law</strong>—the government
                    cannot deprive you of life, liberty, or property without following fair legal procedures.
                    This protection applies to everything from criminal trials to administrative hearings.
