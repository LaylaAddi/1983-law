                <h2 class="section-title">Who Are First Amendment Auditors?</h2>
                <p class="lead text-muted mb-4">
                    First Amendment auditors are citizens who exercise their constitutional rights in public spaces
                    to test whether government officials and law enforcement respect those rights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They film in public areas, photograph government buildings, attend public meetings,
                    and peacefully assert their rights—all while documenting the responses they receive.
                    When officials respond appropriately and respect their rights, auditors often commend them.
                    When officials violate their rights, auditors capture evidence that can be used to
                    educate the public and hold government accountable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>These auditors come from all walks of life.</strong> Some are military veterans
                    who fought for our freedoms overseas and now protect them at home. Some are journalists
                    testing press freedoms. Some are everyday citizens who simply believe in the Constitution.
                    Some approach their work with friendly conversation; others are more confrontational.
                    But regardless of their style, they share a common purpose: ensuring that our rights
                    don't exist only on paper.

                    <p>
                        Government operates best when citizens can observe and document public servants
                        performing their duties. Auditors help ensure that transparency isn't just a buzzword.

                        When government officials know they might be recorded, they're more likely to

                    <p>
                        Some auditors take a friendly, conversational approach. They explain what they're doing,
                        answer questions politely, and use interactions as teaching moments. When officials
                        respect their rights, they thank them and share positive encounters. Their goal is
                        to educate both officials and viewers about constitutional rights through
                        positive engagement.

                    <p>
                        Other auditors take a more assertive stance. They believe rights must be firmly
                        asserted to be protected. They may decline to answer questions, refuse to provide ID
                        when not legally required, and stand their ground when officials push back.
                        Their style may seem confrontational, but they're testing whether officials will
                        respect rights even when it's inconvenient.
